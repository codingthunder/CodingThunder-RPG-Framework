The following are the individual steps taken in resolving the error for the first video tutorial.
They are included both for my sake, and for the sake of those following along with the tutorial.

# Attempt 1
- Didn't work because the InkTrigger's "Ink Knot" was capitalized incorrectly.
```
=exit
???: Hey! Wait! Don't go out! It's unsafe! Wild Po---
???: I've just been informed by my lawyer that I'm not allowed to make that reference.
???: Get your stinky butt back inside the classroom!
Cmd=Move:Target=$$Scene.PlayerCharacter:Dir=0:Speed=3:Dist=2
-> END
```

# Attempt 2
